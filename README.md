Alchemist
=========

An Elder Scrolls Online addon for alchemists!

What does it do?
----------------

This addon tells you which alchemy reagents (in your current inventory/bank) to combine, and in what order, to get the maximum number of new traits.

If there's no unknown traits available to be discovered, it will tell you that as well.

How does it work?
-----------------

The addon will activate as soon as you interact (click on) an Alchemy Station. When you do that, an extra window will open up with a list of optimal reagent combinations, in order.
