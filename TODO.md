TODO / ideas
------------

- Support three reagent combinations (for "Laboratory Use" passive). The code does support it, but the current algorithm is too slow (on slow computers.)

- It would be nice if you could tell it what types of potions you are interested in creating, in a prioritized list, and let the mod see what's available and not.

- Prettier UI. Show reagent and trait icons, hover effect tooltip, use table instead of list.

- Make it possible to click on the Alchemist window to automatically craft the selected item.

- There seems to be a bug that causes nothing to show up after crafting sometimes (seems to be caused by false traits, so no need to fix probably)
